# travis-intro-ruby

This is an example application written in Ruby for
introducing users to basic features of Travis CI.

> This is a second portion of the guided tour of Travis CI.
> If you haven't done so, please start with the
> [initial stage](../../tree/01.intro).

## Sign up for Travis CI

After forking this repository, head over to [travis-ci.org](https://travis-ci.org).
If you don't yet have a Travis CI account, you would be asked to
authorize Travis CI to [access user data](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/github-oauth-scopes).

## Synchronize data

The new repository needs to be visible to Travis CI.

### You just signed up

After initial signup, the user data (including what repositories your account has access to)
are synchronized.

### You already had a Travis CI account

If you already have a Travis CI account, the new repository is probably not yet visible to
Travis CI.
It is time to manually initiate the synchronization at your
[profile page](https://travis-ci.org/profile).

## Enable this repository on Travis CI

After synchronizing user data, `travis-intro-ruby` shows up in your list of repositories.
You can search for it in the search field if it is not visible.

## Next step

Time to head on over to [the next step](../../tree/03.first_build).
